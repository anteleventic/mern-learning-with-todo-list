# Intro
Welcome to my MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) Stack journey! üöÄ Let's rewind to the birth of this repository, the INIT commit. Now, the INIT commit isn't your typical fresh start; it's more like the middle of my learning process. So, buckle up as I unravel the undocumented chapters of my coding part.

### <ins>NodeJS - W3Schools</ins>
Embarking on my MERN Stack journey, I kicked off with [W3Schools' NodeJS tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/default.asp), mastering the basics of routing and file manipulation. Eager for more complexity, I sought to connect NodeJS with MongoDB. W3Schools' Windows-centric lectures left me lost as a Mac user, pushing me to MongoDB Atlas. Though not on my local machine, I made strides‚Äîconnecting to a cluster, executing commands, and dabbling in CRUD operations. Yet, I craved the local experience.

Venturing into repositories, I researched and discovered Docker‚Äîan old acquaintance from my frontend days. While I initially halted my NodeJS and MongoDB quest, a realization struck: Docker could recreate these environments locally. Time to pick up where I left off and unleash the full potential of MERN on my machine. üöÄüíª

### <ins>Docker</ins>
Continuing my journey post-NodeJS and MongoDB exploration, I delved into [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) with the help of their documentation. The Getting Started section was my compass, and I successfully dockerized my NodeJS-MongoDB connection. Eager for more, I aimed to build two containers‚Äîone for the server, the other for the MongoDB database. Though I faced a minor struggle with environments, I swiftly overcame it.

However, my focus shifted back to the primary goal: running NodeJS-MongoDB on my local machine. Leveraging my cluster experience, this part was a breeze. Along the way, I integrated ExpressJS, adding another layer to my expanding skill set. üê≥üöÄ

### <ins>Server - Client Side Project </ins>
Navigating through the intricacies of Docker and inter-container communication became a pivotal challenge in my journey. After swiftly setting up my client-side React TS app without Docker, transitioning into a containerized environment brought unforeseen struggles. Despite referencing various repositories, the missing puzzle piece eluded me for weeks.

It dawned on me that the Docker build process hinges on the context, a realization that sparked both frustration and relief. I combed through the Docker Docs and countless tutorials, seeking answers. Yet, the elusive concept of context persisted, rarely discussed in the resources I found. Determined to simplify the process, I honed in on the docker-compose.yml file, resolving to achieve my goal without a myriad of commands.

And finally, the breakthrough happened! With newfound clarity, I embarked on [Jad Joubran's React JS](https://react-tutorial.app/) course. While TypeScript posed minor challenges, swift research unraveled any confusion. Step by step, I approached the creation of a modest TODO List, mastering the art of adding, marking, and removing items from the database. The journey, though riddled with hurdles, shaped my skills and resilience in the realm of MERN. üö¢üíª
